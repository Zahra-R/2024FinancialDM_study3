    <h2> Welcome to this study! </h2>
    <p> In this study you will repeatedly choose between two options. Your choices will involve both monetary outcomes, which will determine your bonus, and real-world carbon emissions. </p>

    <p> <b> Thus, your choices will have real-world consequences for your own payment and for the environment!</b></p>

    <p> There will be three blocks of the main task, one with 12 and two with 84 rounds each and at the end of the study one choice will be randomly selected to be implemented.</p>

    <p> This means you will be paid and the emission of that round will be realized in the real world according to the choice you made. </p>

    <p> As you do not know which choice will be implemented in advance, please make every choice as if this choice will be implemented for real at the end of the study. </p>
